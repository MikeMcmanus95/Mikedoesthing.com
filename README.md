I've always understood the importance of having a personal website, but felt that I lacked the skill to implement one the way I wanted to, and after finishing up at <a href="https://github.com/FullstackAcademy">Fullstack Academy</a>, I was finally ready to start working on my site.

I decided to approach this as I would any other personal project, and do my best to leverage the latest technologies available to me. I ended up using React, with the awesome <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">GatsbyJS framework</a> to build the layout of my site. Gatsby allowed me to implement sever side rendering, which along with React's SPA architecture, makes the load times lightning fast across the site. I also used GraphQL for data management, which was kind of intimidating at first, but ended up being a very useful tool. Gatsby has some amazing features, like <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/glossary/static-site-generator/">static page generation</a>, where all I have to do is feed it data via a Markdown file! Never being much of a CSS guru myself, I also took this time to learn more about SASS, which proved to be an amazing technology for making my styling more modular. This in turn helped to make my site nice and <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcmanus95/Mikedoesthing.com/blob/master/src/scss/_mobile.scss">responsive</a>.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. If you have any suggestions (or catch any bugs) please let me know!
