This was an app that was built as my final project submission for Fullstack Academy. My teammates
and I decided to make a social media, dating app esque site, that allowed users to connect and chat
with eachother, much like Tinder or Hinge. We also wanted to implement new technologies outside of
what we learned at Fullstack. I advocated for using a NoSQL database, specifically Firebase, and
as a result that was what we ended up using. I also wanted a website that can effectively function
as a mobile app, so we added Progressive Web Application functionality as well. For our frontend, we used
React and Redux for reusable components and effective state management.

You can take a look at our code to see how we implemented our <a href="https://github.com/codewars-clone/TryCatch/blob/master/src/client/store/reducers/likes.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> custom matching algorithm</a>, as well as other cool features like <a href="https://github.com/codewars-clone/TryCatch/blob/master/src/client/store/reducers/chat.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">realtime chat!</a>
