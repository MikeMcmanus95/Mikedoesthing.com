# Walkthrough

**Sign Up**

We begin by clicking the `Sign Up` button, and filling out some basic info.

**Customize Your Profile**

Next, we have the option to add extra user information such as preferences to fine tune your matches.

**The Try Feed**

After selecting your preferences, your `Try` feed will render a stack of prospects that match your age and gender interest. You can press the green `Like` button to indicate your interest in the person.

**Answering Coding Challenges**

Some user profiles will have optional coding challenges that you can complete. You can click the `Submit` button in the bottom right once you're done. This is effectively the same as sending a like.

**The Await Feed**

In the `Await` feed, users can see who has liked them already, along with viewing a users code if they have submitted any.

**The Catch Feed**

The `Catch` feed is where you can see all the users that you have matched with. A match is created when there is a mutual `Like`. From this screen, you can click on a user to chat in realtime.
