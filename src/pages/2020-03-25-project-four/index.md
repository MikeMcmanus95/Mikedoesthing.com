This project was our first major group project at Fullstack Academy, codenamed "Grace Shopper". We were tasked with building an e-commerce store complete with user authentication, a fully populated database, secure routes, and plenty more. My groupmates and I adopted the Agile methodology, conducting daily stand-ups each morning, and writing up our user stories on our <a href="https://github.com/YankeeStatium/FireKicks/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project board</a>, which were then divided among each of us. We worked in vertical slices, where one person would implement a feature from the database level, to the front end component. We also took a test driven development approach, adding unit tests across the stack. Lastly, CI/CD with Travis was another measure we took that greatly increased our code throughput.

You can take a look at our code to see how we <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcmanus95/FireKicks/blob/master/client/store/cart.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implemented the cart</a> with Redux, or how we <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcmanus95/FireKicks/blob/master/client/components/Checkout.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dealt with checkout using the Stripe API</a>.
